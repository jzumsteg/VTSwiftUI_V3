    <h1>Verbos "How-To"</h1>
        <h2>The Basics</h2>
        <std>Verbos allows you to drill yourself quickly on Spanish
            verbs, in all their tenses and forms. You can decide what tenses and forms to
            test yourself on, and you can create and save lists of verbs to study. Touch the screen once and a new verb form appears, without the answer. Touch the screen again to get the answer. Repeat this whenever you've got a few minutes for study. </std></p>
        <h2>Top Right-hand corner button</h3><std>In the upper-right hand corner of the view, is a rectanglewith three dots in it. Tap on this and a view of appropriate settings open. In Drill and Auto view,these allow you to choose how Verbos will choose verbs to drill you on. Options are:
                <li><stdbld>Use all verbs</stdbld></li>
                <li><stdbld>Use one verb</stdbld> You can select just one verb on which to drill</li>
                <li><stdbld>Use verb list</stdbld> If you have created one or more verb lists, they will be shown and you cna select which verb list to draw. You create verb lists in the <strong>Verb Lists</strong> option of the <strong>Settings</strong> tab.</li>
                <h2>Bottom buttons</h3><std>There are two buttons at the bottom of the Drill view. These are:
                    <li><stdbld>Add/Remove from verb lists</stdbld><std> - If you're using the "All Verbs"" option, you can add the currently shown infinitive to an already-created verb list. If you're using a Verb List option to display drills, you can remove the current infinnitive from the verb list. This button will change to the appropriate action..</std></li>
                    <li><stdbld>Conjugation</stdbld><std> - shows the entire conjugation, for all tenses, of the verb currently on the Drill View.</std></li>
        <h2>Verbtrainer "Modes"</h2>
        <p><std>At the bottom of the Drill View screen you'll see five tabs. The three on the left - Drill View,Test View and Auto View - are the modes of using Verbos. The two on the right - Verb Selection and Settings - have options for Verbos.
            <H2>Modes</h2>
        <li><std>Drill</std></li>
        <li><std>Test</std></li>
        <li><std>Auto</std></li>
        <p><std>Each of these takes you to a different "mode" of operations. These modes are discussed below.</std></p>
        <h3>Drill</h3>
        <p><std>In "Drill" mode. you can drill yourself on verb forms, as fast as you want to. Verbos chooses a verb form at random from its database of 90,000+ verb forms, and presents one on the view, without the answer. You can then say the answer to yourself, and touch the screen again, which presents the answer to you.<br><br>Touch the screen again to get a new verb form.<br><br>
        You can select what verb forms you'd like to test yourself on. You can select what tenses you'd like to use, what types of verbs (regular, irregular, etc.), what endings (-ar, -ir, -er) and what person/numbers (yo, Ã©l, etc.). Do that in the Settings mode, described below.</std></p>
        <h3>Test</h3>
        <p><std>In "Test" mode, you can set up tests to measure your progress. There are three types of tests:
        <li><std>Timed and Number of Verbs - You can set the length of the test, and the maximum number of verb tests.The test ends when either the time limit is reached, or the number of verb limit is reached, whichever comes first.</std></li>
        <li><std>Number of Verbs - You can set the number of verbs on which you wish to be tested. When you run the test, it will end when you've reached the limit you set.</std></li>
        <li><std>Timed - You can also set a time limit only; the test will end when you reach the time limit.</std></li>
        <p><std>You set the type of test, and the test parameters by touching the "Test Settings" button at the bottom of the view.</std>
        <h3>Start Button</h3><p><std>Starts the test using the parameters you set. Test View will remember those parameters from session to session.<br><br>When a test is done, you'll see a Score; you can choose to save the score if you wish. Doing so  lets you see your progress over time, as the Drill History button shows all the tests you've saved.
        <h3>Test Settings button</h3><std> Set the test parameters, as outlined above</std></p>
        <h3>History button</h3><std>Shows the history of all the tests you've saved.</std></p>
        <H2>Auto</h2>
        <p><std>In <strong>Auto</strong> mode, Verbos cycles through a verb and an answer without requiring any touches on the user's part. How long the verb is displayed before the answer is shown, and how long the answer remains on the screen until a new verb drill is shown can be adjusted from between 2 seconds and 30 seconds. This is done in the <strong>Auto Settings</strong> screen on the <Strong>Settings</strong> page.
        <h2>Verb Selection</h2>
        <p><std>Tap this button and you'll see a page that allows you to limit the drills to certain choices. You can set:
            <li><std>Simple Tenses - what simple tenses you want included in drills. If, for instance, you wanted to drill only on <i>presente</i>, unselect all others and selecte <i>presente</i>.</std></li>
            <li><std>Compound tenses</std></li>
            <li><std>Verb types - <i>regular, irregular, stem-changing</i>, etc.</std></li>
            <li><std>Person/Number - <i>yo, tu, el/elles, etc.</i></std></li>
            <li><std>Endings - <i>-ar, -ir, -er</i> infinitives</std></li>
            See all the choices for each category by tapping the choice; the button will expand to show choices. Tap to select and deselct your choices.



        <h2>Settings</h2>
    <p><std>Here you'll make selections that help you customize Verbos to your specific needs. You can easily change these at any time.</std></p>
        <p><stdbld>Verb Lists</stdbld><std> Touch this to go to a screen that allows you to create a new verb list or modify verb lists you've already created (you can also delete verb lists there).<p>
        <p><stdbld>Palette</stdbld><std> Choose whether you want Verbos to use dark letters on a light background or light letters on a dark background.</p>
            <p><stdbld>Display Opts</stdbld><std> Set options for the display. Options are:</p>
        <h3>What Translation</h3>
        <li><stdbld>Show Infinitive Translation</stdbld> Shows just the Spanish infinitive translation (i.e., if the infinitive is <i>dar</i>, the translation will be <i>give</i>).
        <li><stdbld>Show verb form translation</stdbld> Shows the translation of the verb form (i.e., if the verb is <i>dar</i>, tense is <i>presente</i>, person/number is <i>yo</i>, the translation will be "I give").
        <h3>When to show translation</h3> Options are:
            <li><stdbld>With quiz</stdbld> Shows the translation when a new verb is displayed in Drill or Test modes
            <li><stdbld>With answer</stdbld>- Shows the translation when the answer is displayed.
            <li><stdbld>Never show translation</stdbld> The translation is never displayed.
        <h3>Quiz on...</h3> This determines what is displayed on the Drill and Test modes. Options are:
        <li><stdbld>Spanish infinitive</stdbld>
        <li><stdbld>English infinitive</stdbld>
        <li><stdbld>English translation</stdbld> This is used if you would like to drill from seeing the English translation of the verb form. When you select this, the English translation (<i>I will give</i>) will appear rather than the infinitive <i>dar</i> and the tense not appear. This allows you to practice selecting the correct Spanish verb form from its Engligh translation.p You can see the tense by tapping in the <stdbld>tenso</stdbld> field.
        <h3>Pronouns with answer</h3> You can choose to see the personal pronouns with the answer or to just the verb form.

 <h1>Accessibility</h1> <p> If you have the Large Type feature of the Accessibilty settings, you may encounter some lists that are a mess. Verbes is not - yet - set up to handle Accessibilty features. You can fix this by setting the Accessibilty Large Font Size setting to a much lower size. I am working on a better fix for this and hope to have it Real Soon Now. I apologize to those who need a larger font.</p>
