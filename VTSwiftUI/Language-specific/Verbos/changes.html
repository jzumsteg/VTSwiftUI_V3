        <h1>Changes in XXAPPXX XXVERSIONXX</h1>
        <p><std>This version of XXAPPXX has some changes, but they aren't major changes in the view of you, the user. The User Interface has been modernized to provide an up-to-date and cleaner look.
        <p><std>Other than that, the big change, which is important to me as a developer but has little affect on you as the user, is that XXAPPXX has been re-written from the ground up to use the latest changes from Apple, including its new programmimg language Swift and a new way to create the User Interface. These changes improve the reliability of XXAPPXX and will make it easier for me to make changes and bug fixes. Unfortunately, the re-write means there could be new bugs in the App. The previous version had been in use for five years, so I'd pretty much wrung all the bugs out. I've tested the daylights out of the new version, so I hope I've squashed all the bugs, but...</std></p>
        <p><std>Thanks for using XXAPPXX, and please let me know if you find any errors or have ideas for improvement. You can contact me using the <strong>Contact Us</strong> option of the Settings menu, or send me an email at support@verbtrainers.com. I promise that I respond to <em>all</em> emails!</std></p><p></p><p><std>Thanks, John</std></p>
